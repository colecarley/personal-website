<Ccheader>About Me</Ccheader>

<Ccp>
    Hello! My name is Cole Carley. I am a Software Engineer with a passion for
    compilers, programming languages, and web development.

    <br />
    <br />

    Beyond language design, I have a strong background in full-stack
    development, working with databases, dev ops, and frontend frameworks like
    Svelte and Angular. Whether it’s building scalable applications or
    optimizing execution pipelines, I love solving complex problems with elegant
    solutions.

    <br />
    <br />

    I’m currently exploring new ideas in compiler optimizations, type systems,
    and WebAssembly performance. If you’re interested in discussing programming
    languages, software performance, or anything in between, feel free to
    connect with me!
